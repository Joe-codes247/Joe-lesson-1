    The animal populace of the poorly run Manor Farm near Willingdon,
    <br>  England, is ripened for rebellion by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer, Mr. Jones. One night, the exalted boar, Old Major,<br> holds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song cBeasts of England".<br> When Old Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon,
    assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property "Animal Farm".<br> They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, "All animals are equal". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. To commemorate the start of Animal Farm,
    Snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn.<br> Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.<br> The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the "Battle of the Cowshed"), Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill.<br> Napoleon disputes this idea, and matters come to a head, which culminates in Napoleon's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander.

     <h3 class="pt">Paragraph 2</h3>
<p class="pp">
    When Edna, the demented, elderly, and widowed matriarch of the family, goes missing, her daughter Kay and granddaughter Sam travel to their remote family home to find her.
    They discover the house locked from the inside, and a strange black mold-like substance on an upstairs wall.
    Much of the furniture has been adorned with Post-it notes of reminders for Edna.
</p>
    <h3 class="pt">Paragraph 3</h3>
<p class="pp">
    That night, Sam is visited by their young neighbour Jamie, who states that he had not been to visit Edna for a while after his father had told him not to go back to the house.
    Sam and Kay grow increasingly disturbed by a loud creaking from inside the walls and the appearance of more black mold throughout the house.
    Kay experiences nightmares of a withered rotting corpse in an old shack in the woodlands.
