    The most widely known genus of sabre-toothed cats is Smilodon, the “sabre-toothed tiger.” A large, short-limbed cat<br>
    that lived in North and South America during the Pleistocene Epoch, it was about<br>
    the size of the modern African lion (Panthera leo) and represents the<br>
    peak of sabre-tooth evolution.<br>
